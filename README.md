# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

The data for Twitter Sentiment Analysis was obtained from SemEval (Semantic Evaluation) - Task 4, 2017. The data consists of 45,026, 2000, and 2379 number of training, validation, and testing samples respectively.

The data is preprocessed and the sequences are tokenised to train the ML model. A Neural Network with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer is constructed to train the Twitter data and hence classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.

The model achieves an average prediction accuracy of 65% over three test sets.
